# conFusion-Angular-SPA
Angular version of conFusion repository that fetches data from local json-server

First of all, you have to install json-server to your local machine by running following command:
  i.  For windows: <h3>npm install json-server</h3>
  ii. For mac or linux: <h3>sudo npm install json-server</h3>
 
then go to this repository's folder on your local machine and run "<h3>json-server --watch db.json</h3>" (without quotes).

Now your local server is up and ready, open <h3>http://localhost:3000/</h3> in your browser and check out this 'Single Page Application' made using Angular

Thank you for your time.
