# conFusion-Angular-SPA
Angular version of conFusion repository that fetches data from local json-server

First of all, you have to install json-server to your local machine by running following command:
  i.  For windows: npm install json-server
  ii. For mac or linux: sudo npm install json-server
 
then go to this repository's folder on your local machine and run "json-server --watch db.json" (without quotes).

Now your local server is up and ready, open http://localhost:3000/ in your browser and check out this 'Single Page Application' made using Angular

Thank you for your time.
